# Feed samples for Jasper 

Here are some examples of feeds that you can create. 

All of these feeds curate content a differert way. Some show you posts of dogs, some show you posts your friends have reacted to, some might even show you posts that most people have not seen. The main idea behind Jasper, is that as consumers of social products, we have missed out on 2 key things. 

1. Transparency as to why and how posts end up in our feeds. 
2. Control over the algorithms that determine what enters our feeds. 

And at Jasper, we aim to fix that.
